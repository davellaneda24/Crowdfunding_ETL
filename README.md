# Crowdfunding_ETL
- In this project, I utilized Pandas, Python, and PostgreSQL in order in order to extract, transform and load crowdfunding data from 2 differnet Excel files into a database.
- I began by first merging and cleaning the data within a Pandas workbook and creating 4 CSVs (campaign, contacts, category, and subcategory).
- Once the CSVs were created I utilized QuickDBD in order to generate an ERD that would allow me to understand the relationship between the columns in each CSV in order to create a SQL schema.
- I utilized PostgreSQL to create the table schema and finished by uploading the CSVs into the PostgreSQL database.
